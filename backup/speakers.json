Sin dalla giovane età mi sono avvicinato al mondo della tecnologia e dello sviluppo software. Android User since 2010, attualmente lavoro come Android Developer in IQUII, a Roma. Seguo tutto ciò che riguarda il mondo Google, in particolare Android e Assistant. Mi piace tutto ciò che riguarda il design e la UX. Ho una smodata passione per le architetture software e la pulizia del codice e nel tempo libero amo la fotografie, leggere, guardare Film/Serie TV o bere una birra in compagnia.","badges":[],"shortBio":"Android user since 2010, UX/UI addicted e Android Developer presso IQUII","photoUrl":"https://sessionize.com/image?f=430b357c0f86862fd6a0e4cf843ad2cc,400,400,True,False,3c-59f5-493c-90aa-45d6adb6ab72.ff4c12d4-f157-4127-9e48-61808056744a.jpg","name":"Leonardo Pirro","companyLogo":"http://www.geosmartcampus.it/geosmart/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LOGO-IQUII-300x127.jpg","title":"Android Developer ","photo":"https://sessionize.com/image?f=430b357c0f86862fd6a0e4cf843ad2cc,400,400,True,False,3c-59f5-493c-90aa-45d6adb6ab72.ff4c12d4-f157-4127-9e48-61808056744a.jpg"},"lorenzo_quiroli":{"order":5,"featured":false,"company":"busuu","companyLogoUrl":"https://theme.zdassets.com/theme_assets/75720/069b572547e53cd5a04d03c24043332c6e78034c.png","socials":[{"name":"Twitter","icon":"twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/lorenzoquiroli"}],"country":"London, UK","bio":"Born and raised in a small town near Milan, now living in London where he's happily coding Android apps.
